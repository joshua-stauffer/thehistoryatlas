# The History Atlas

The History Atlas is a web application that stores scholarly citations correlating historical people with a time and place, and presents an interactive map searchable by time period, geographic area, or person.

The project was my primary focus during my batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com), a three month self-directed retreat for programmers in NYC from April-June 2021.
