Commands - json objects capturing user intent in the UI, eventually translated 
              into Emitted Events by the Write Model.

Events - json objects capturing canonized user intent. Considered emitted (and 
          provisional) upon creation in the Write Model, and become persisted 
          (and permanent) in the Event Store. Serve as the single source of
          truth across the application, and are generally accessible through
          the History Player service for building/rebuilding local state.
