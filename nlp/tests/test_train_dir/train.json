[{"content": "Dieterich Buxtehude most likely attended the Latin School at Elsinore and received his music education from his father. In 1657 or 1658 he became organist at his father\u2019s former church at Helsingborg and in 1660 moved back to Elsinore as organist of the Marienkirche, a German-speaking congregation. With the death of Franz Tunder on 5 November 1667 the position of organist of the Marienkirche at L\u00fcbeck, one of the most important in north Germany, became vacant. After several other organists had applied for the post and been rejected, Buxtehude was chosen on 11 April 1668. At the same time he was appointed Werkmeister, a post encompassing the duties of secretary, treasurer and business manager of the church; it carried a separate salary but at this period was given to the organist. Buxtehude became a citizen of L\u00fcbeck on 23 July 1668, and a few days later, on 3 August 1668, he married Anna Margarethe Tunder, the younger daughter of his predecessor. It is not known whether this was a condition of his employment, as it was to be with his successor, but the practice was not unusual at the time. Seven daughters were born of this union, four of whom survived to adulthood: Magdalena (or Helena) Elisabeth (b 1670), Anna Margreta (b 1675), Anna Sophia (b 1678) and Dorothea Catrin (b 1683).

His most significant output was orchestral: seven symphonies, one violin concerto, several sets of incidental music and numerous tone poems, often based on incidents taken from the Kalevala, the Finnish-language folk epic. His work is distinguished by startlingly original adaptations of familiar elements: unorthodox treatments of triadic harmony, orchestral colour and musical process and structure. His music evokes a range of characteristic moods and topics, from celebratory nationalism and political struggle to cold despair and separatist isolation; from brooding contemplations of \u2018neo-primitive\u2019 musical ideas or slowly transforming sound textures to meditations on the mysteries, grandeurs and occasionally lurking terrors of archetypal folk myths or natural landscapes. A master of symphonic continuity and compressed, \u2018logical\u2019 musical structure, he grounded much of his music in his own conception of the Finnish national temperament. Throughout the 20th century Finland regarded him as a national hero and its most renowned artist.

Thirdly, Sibelius's aesthetic was wrenched in the direction of the progressive, in part as a result of coming into contact with certain key works. One was Bruckner's Third Symphony (the 1888\u20139 version, which he heard in December), with its monumental scale and throbbing ostinato sound-sheets.

That city, which boasted one of the largest churches in Christendom in the basilica of S Petronio, was the home of a flourishing school of composers, whose outstanding figures included Cazzati, Perti, Colonna, G.B. Vitali and, nearer the end of the century, Torelli.

In 1676 and the three following years he performed in Lenten oratorios in S Marcello, a church under the patronage of Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili. In 1676 and 1678 he was once again present in S Luigi dei Francesi on 25 August, playing second violin to Carlo Mannelli, whom he also partnered in an \u2018Esposizione delle 40 ore\u2019 at S Marcello on 20 September 1678. On 6 January 1679 he played at the inauguration of the Teatro Capranica with Pasquini's Dove \u00e8 amore \u00e8 piet\u00e0. The earliest glimpse of the man behind this impressive series of public appearances comes from a letter he wrote on 13 May 1679 to Count Fabrizio Laderchi, an official of the Tuscan court. Corelli mentioned that he had entered the service of Queen Christina of Sweden as a chamber musician and was busy composing sonatas for her first \u2018academy\u2019; these completed, he would supply the count with a sonata for violin and lute. In another letter to Laderchi of 3 June 1679 he reported the sending of the sonata, whose bass part could also be played on the cello. It has been suggested that this composition is the Corelli work included in an anthology of sonatas for violin and cello published in Bologna during the 1690s. In 1681 Corelli dedicated his first opus, 12 trio sonatas of the \u2018church\u2019 variety, to Queen Christina, describing them, perhaps with exaggeration, as the \u2018first fruits [primitie] of his studies\u2019. Christina was before long replaced by Cardinal Pamphili as Corelli's most important patron, but she was still able to call on his services for special occasions. An accademia per musica by Pasquini performed in Christina's Palazzo Riario in honour of Roger Palmer (Earl of Castlemaine), James II's ambassador to the Holy See, by 150 string players led by Corelli and 100 singers on 2, 7 and 9 February 1687 evoked much admiration. In March 1689 Corelli directed a large band of players in two solemn masses, the first in Il Ges\u00f9 and the second in Santa Casa, Loreto, to celebrate Christina's recovery from illness (a short-lived rejoicing, as she died the next month). Both ensembles included trumpets, and on the second occasion Corelli contributed \u2018a new sinfonia with trumpets\u2019. This mention of a trumpet sinfonia increases the likelihood that the well-known trumpet sonata attributed to Corelli in a 1704 publication of Walsh and in various Italian and English manuscripts is a genuine work, whether or not identical with the sonata he is alleged to have composed for Mr Twiselton, trumpeter to the Duke of Aumont, in an advertisement in the Daily Courant of 16 March 1713.\r", "entities": [[2626, 2639, "TIME", 33, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [2535, 2547, "PERSON", 34, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2387, 2392, "PERSON", 32, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2367, 2371, "TIME", 31, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [2354, 2361, "PERSON", 30, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2193, 2200, "PERSON", 29, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2022, 2028, "PLACE", 28, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [1908, 1915, "PERSON", 27, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1897, 1907, "TIME", 26, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1845, 1869, "TIME", 25, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1818, 1825, "PERSON", 24, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1714, 1726, "PERSON", 23, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1652, 1660, "PERSON", 22, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1501, 1518, "PERSON", 21, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1463, 1472, "PERSON", 20, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1353, 1368, "PERSON", 19, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1275, 1282, "PERSON", 18, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1270, 1274, "TIME", 17, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1241, 1248, "PLACE", 16, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [1005, 1016, "TIME", 15, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [993, 1001, "PERSON", 14, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [790, 815, "PERSON", 13, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [737, 744, "PERSON", 12, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [679, 702, "PERSON", 11, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [664, 675, "TIME", 10, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [441, 455, "TIME", 9, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [419, 436, "TIME", 8, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [330, 344, "PERSON", 7, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [294, 303, "TIME", 6, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [236, 240, "TIME", 5, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [227, 231, "TIME", 4, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [195, 222, "PERSON", 3, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [80, 84, "TIME", 2, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [71, 75, "PLACE", 1, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [22, 29, "PERSON", 0, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"]]}, {"content": "Corelli's whereabouts between 3 June 1679 (the date of the second letter to Laderchi) and 30 April 1681 (the date of the dedication of op.1) are uncertain. One could easily believe that he remained in Rome were it not for reports of a visit to Germany around this time. The claim by the composer Caspar Printz, elaborated by J.A. Hiller, that Corelli visited the Bavarian court seems in part to result from a confusion of Corelli with Giuseppe Torelli. Chrysander's mention of a visit to the Hanoverian court is no better substantiated. In 1682 Corelli reappeared at S Luigi, now as leader of ten violins. The second violin was Matteo Fornari, a pupil to whom he became devoted and who from then on was rarely to be absent from his side. On every subsequent 25 August up to and including the year 1708, when old age and failing health forced his retirement, Corelli paid his annual visit to the church. In 1684 he was inscribed, together with Alessandro Scarlatti, as a member of the Congregazione di S Cecilia, a body of whose instrumental section he became head in 1700. Also in 1684 he began to play regularly for musical functions organized by Fornari's employer Cardinal Pamphili, taking responsibility for the engagement and payment of the players. The academies held on Sundays at the cardinal's Palazzo al Corso were a focal point of Roman musical life, and it was perhaps at these that Corelli's first set of chamber trios, published in 1685 as op.2 and dedicated to Pamphili, were first heard. A sequential passage in the Allemanda of the third sonata (reproduced in Grove5) gave rise to one of those acrimonious disputes concerning musical propriety so characteristic of the age. When first played in Bologna, where the sonatas had been brought out later that same year, these bars caused astonishment on account of a series of ostensible parallel 5ths between the first violin and the bass. At Colonna's instigation a certain Matteo Zani wrote a courteous letter to Corelli asking for his explanation. Corelli took the request in rather bad part: since, in his view, the 5ths were indirect and therefore legitimate, the Bolognese musicians must be ignorant of the rules of music. Thereupon the matter broadened into an inter-city dispute, each side enlisting support from local musicians, so that the correspondence continued for some months. It is unlikely that the Bolognese musicians, initially at least, were motivated by resentment at their former colleague's move to Rome, as has been hinted, for even now many will find the passage inherently contentious.\r", "entities": [[2485, 2489, "PLACE", 26, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [2014, 2021, "PERSON", 25, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1978, 1985, "PERSON", 24, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1937, 1949, "PERSON", 23, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1712, 1719, "PLACE", 22, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [1476, 1484, "PERSON", 21, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1446, 1450, "TIME", 20, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1167, 1184, "PERSON", 19, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1081, 1085, "TIME", 18, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1067, 1071, "TIME", 17, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [943, 963, "PERSON", 16, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [906, 910, "TIME", 15, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [858, 865, "PERSON", 14, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [797, 801, "TIME", 13, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [628, 642, "PERSON", 11, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [545, 552, "PERSON", 10, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [540, 544, "TIME", 9, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [435, 451, "PERSON", 8, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [422, 429, "PERSON", 7, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [343, 350, "PERSON", 6, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [325, 336, "PERSON", 5, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [296, 309, "PERSON", 4, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [244, 251, "PLACE", 3, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [201, 205, "PLACE", 2, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [90, 103, "TIME", 1, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [30, 41, "TIME", 0, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"]]}, {"content": "On 9 July 1687 Pamphili engaged Corelli as his music master at a monthly salary of ten Florentine piastres. Corelli went to live at the cardinal's palace, accompanied by Fornari and a servant, Bernardino Salviati. Another musician employed by Pamphili was the Spanish cellist G.B. Lulier, often nicknamed by the Romans \u2018Giovannino del violone\u2019. Corelli, Fornari and Lulier often performed together as a trio or, in the context of orchestral music, as a concertino of soloists. Lulier was also a composer, and a good example of the way in which his talents were harnessed to those of Corelli can be seen in the oratorio S Beatrice d'Este, which was performed early in 1689 in Pamphili's residence in honour of the visiting Cardinal Rinaldo d'Este. The music was by Lulier, and a very large orchestra under Corelli was mustered for the occasion, consisting of 39 violins, 10 violas, 17 cellos (violoni), 10 double basses, one lute, two trumpets and (presumably) one or more keyboard instruments \u2013 over 80 players, among whom were Bernardo Pasquini and Francesco Gasparini. (A Roman orchestra of more typical size, such as the one Corelli directed at S Marcello in 1690, had a concertino supported by harpsichord, with a concerto grosso of four violins, two violas, one cello, two double basses and organ.) The oratorio was taken later that year to the Este court at Modena, and for this revival, if not already for the Roman performance, Corelli supplied an Introduzione (overture) and Sinfonia (probably the overture to the second part). The same division of labour between Corelli and the composer of the vocal music must often have occurred at Pamphili's court. On 20 September 1689 Corelli dedicated his third opus, 12 more sonate da chiesa, to Francesco II, Duke of Modena.

The 22-year-old Ottoboni had been raised to the purple at the end of 1689 through an act of flagrant nepotism by his uncle, Pope Alexander VIII, and filled a succession of high ecclesiastical offices. Corelli went to live in his palace, the Cancelleria, where academies were regularly held on Monday evenings. Ottoboni acted towards the composer more like a friend than an employer, and his correspondence shows the affection he had for the entire Corelli family. Op.4, a second set of chamber trios, was dedicated to Ottoboni in 1694. Corelli continued to write sinfonias and concertos (the terminological distinction is often unclear). In 1693 he contributed some \u2018concerti\u2019 to an Applauso musicale a quattro voci by Lulier, and on 10 December 1700 was paid 30 scudi for composing a concerto and sinfonia for the Feast of the Translation of the S Casa, Loreto.

Possibly Corelli felt compelled to increase their quotient of virtuosity, converting what were originally sinfonias for church or theatre into more scintillating works able to stand comparison with the concertos of Torelli, Albinoni, Valentini and other pioneers, and profiting from the technical advances made in his op.5, the celebrated set of violin sonatas dedicated in 1700 to the Electress Sophie Charlotte of Brandenburg. In a notice concerning the papal contralto Matteo Simonelli, Andrea Adami da Bolsena observed in 1711 that Corelli (whom he claimed to be Simonelli's pupil) was just then perfecting his sixth opus, consisting of concertos, which he would shortly publish. On 21 April 1712 Corelli concluded an agreement with the Amsterdam publisher Estienne Roger for the set's publication; his recompense was to be 150 free examples, presumably for resale in Italy. The dedication, penned with the assistance of Ottoboni on 3 December 1712, was to the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm, an admirer to whom the composer had sent a Concertino da camera in 1708. At the end of 1712 Corelli moved out of the Cancelleria into the Palazzo Ermini, a pied \u00e0 terre normally occupied by his brother Giacinto, his nephew Arcangelo and the many possessions, including valuable paintings and musical instruments, that he had accumulated. On 5 January 1713 he wrote his will, bequeathing to cardinals Pietro Ottoboni and Carlo Colonna one painting each, and to Matteo Fornari all his violins, his manuscripts, the plates of his op.4 (\u20184\u2019 is probably in error for \u20185\u2019) and the free examples of his op.6 to come. (After Corelli's death Fornari took out a papal privilege for the concertos and replaced the original dedication with one of his own, similarly inscribed to Johann Wilhelm; in 1716 the elector responded to a petition from Corelli's elder brother Ippolito by conferring on the family the Marquisate of Ladenburg). Corelli died on 8 January 1713 and was embalmed and buried in S Maria della Rotonda (the Pantheon). The anniversary of his death was marked for several years afterwards by solemn performances of his concertos in this church.\r", "entities": [[2285, 2299, "TIME", 38, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [2269, 2276, "PERSON", 37, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2202, 2210, "PERSON", 36, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [2132, 2136, "TIME", 35, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [2113, 2127, "PERSON", 34, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1979, 1986, "PERSON", 33, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1806, 1820, "PERSON", 32, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1766, 1779, "PERSON", 31, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1746, 1761, "PERSON", 30, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1687, 1701, "TIME", 29, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1569, 1578, "PERSON", 28, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1548, 1556, "PERSON", 27, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1438, 1445, "PERSON", 26, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1426, 1437, "TIME", 25, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1413, 1417, "TIME", 24, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1330, 1344, "PERSON", 22, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1285, 1300, "TIME", 20, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [1220, 1225, "PLACE", 19, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [1109, 1123, "PERSON", 18, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1089, 1098, "PLACE", 17, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [1049, 1056, "PERSON", 16, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [1035, 1048, "TIME", 15, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [884, 891, "PERSON", 14, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [874, 878, "TIME", 13, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [838, 861, "PERSON", 12, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [820, 836, "PERSON", 11, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [764, 775, "PLACE", 10, "rgb(116, 138, 92)"], [744, 760, "PERSON", 23, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [722, 726, "TIME", 8, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [582, 591, "PERSON", 7, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [572, 580, "PERSON", 6, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [563, 570, "PERSON", 5, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [357, 364, "PERSON", 4, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [228, 236, "PERSON", 3, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [219, 223, "TIME", 2, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"], [11, 18, "PERSON", 1, "rgb(191, 157, 120)"], [6, 10, "TIME", 0, "rgb(43, 197, 86)"]]}, {"content": "(b Vienna, Feb 9, 1885; d Vienna, Dec 24, 1935).

Much of the second song, for example, is concerned with exploiting the structural and cyclic possibilities inherent in the French 6th chord, with the opening bars systematically transposing the chord halfway around the cycle of 5ths (at which point the original collection of notes is reinstated), the following bars recapitulating the same chord sequence in retrograde (but with the spacing changed so as to emphasize the two major 3rds in the chord) and the final six bars demonstrating that the sequence produced when the chord is transposed around the semitone cycle is identical to that resulting from the original cycle of 5ths transposition.

As is well known, this army never marched, because Henri IV was assassinated on 14 May of that year. What is less well known is that he had also prepared an attack on the duchy of Milan. He had concluded a treaty with Charles Emanuel I of Savoy that envisaged setting up an army of almost 30,000 men and the transferral of the duchy of Milan to the duke of Savoy. After Henri\u2019s assassination, Charles Emanuel I hastened to apologise to Philip III for his collaboration with the French. The war that had been avoided in Italy finally broke out two years later. When Francis III, duke of Mantua and Monferrato, died in 1612, the ambitious Charles Emanuel claimed the possession of Monferrato for himself.

That is likely enough; Christoph is not known to have been a composer. Several early biographers told the story of how Christoph would not allow his brother to use a certain manuscript; how Sebastian copied it by moonlight; how Christoph took the copy away from him; and how he did not recover it until Christoph died. Emanuel and Forkel assumed that Christoph died in 1700, and that Sebastian, left homeless, went to L\u00fcneburg in desperation. Later authors, knowing that Christoph lived on until 1721, and that the brothers had been on good terms, have tended to reject the story \u2013 perhaps unnecessarily, for it may illustrate contemporary attitudes to discipline and restraint. In fact, the story fits in well with the little that is known of the Ohrdruf years, and with the idea that Sebastian taught himself composition by copying. Most probably he recovered his copy when he went to L\u00fcneburg. As for its contents, Forkel implied that it contained works by seven famous composers, three of them northerners.

The Kantor was August Braun, whose compositions have disappeared; the organist, F.C. Morhard, was a nonentity. The organ was repaired in 1701 by J.B. Held, who had worked at Hamburg and L\u00fcbeck; he lodged in the school, and may have taught Bach something about organ building. There was a fine music library, which had been carefully kept up to date; but whether choirboys were allowed to consult it is uncertain. If Braun made good use of it, Bach must have learnt a good deal from the music he had to perform; but his chief interests probably lay outside the school. At the Nikolaikirche was J.J. L\u00f6we (1629\u20131703), distinguished but elderly. The Johanniskirche was another matter, for there the organist was Georg B\u00f6hm (1661\u20131733), who is generally agreed to have influenced Bach. It has been argued that the organist of the Johanniskirche would not have been accessible to a scholar of the Michaelisschule, since the two choirs were not on good terms, and that Bach\u2019s knowledge of B\u00f6hm\u2019s music must have come later, through J.G. Walther. But Emanuel Bach stated in writing that his father had studied B\u00f6hm\u2019s music; and a correction in a note to Forkel shows that his first thought was to say that B\u00f6hm had been his father\u2019s teacher. This hint is supported by the fact that in 1727 Bach named B\u00f6hm as his northern agent for the sale of Partitas nos.2 and 3.

Further, he never had much patience with the semi-competent, and was apt to alienate them by making offensive remarks. One result was his scuffle with J.H. Geyersbach (b 1682). On 4 August 1705 he and his cousin Barbara, elder sister (aged 26) to his future wife, fell in with six students who had been to a christening feast; one of these was Geyersbach, who asked why Bach had insulted him (or his bassoon), and struck him in the face with a stick. Bach drew his sword, but another student separated them. Bach complained to the consistory that it would be unsafe for him to go about the streets if Geyersbach were not punished, and an inquiry was held. The consistory told Bach that he ought not to have insulted Geyersbach and should try to live peaceably with the students; further, he was not (as he claimed) responsible only for the chorales but was expected to help with all kinds of music. Bach replied that if a musical director were appointed, he would be willing enough.", "entities": [[1475, 1479, "PERSON", 14, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1292, 1302, "PERSON", 13, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1252, 1256, "PERSON", 12, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1177, 1187, "PERSON", 11, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1084, 1088, "PERSON", 10, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1027, 1031, "PERSON", 9, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [946, 950, "PERSON", 8, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [920, 930, "PERSON", 7, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [788, 795, "PERSON", 6, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [756, 769, "TIME", 5, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [744, 750, "TIME", 4, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [727, 742, "PERSON", 3, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [464, 468, "PERSON", 2, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [53, 61, "PLACE", 1, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [0, 4, "PERSON", 0, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"]]}, {"content": "On 21 February the consistory asked Bach why he had been away for so long; his replies were unsatisfactory and barely civil.

A contract for alterations had however been signed on 29 June 1712 with H.N. Trebs (1678\u20131748), who had moved from M\u00fchlhausen to Weimar in 1709. Bach and he had worked together on a new organ at Taubach in 1709\u201310, opened by Bach on 26 October 1710; in 1711 he gave Trebs a handsome testimonial, and in 1713 he and Walther became godfathers to Trebs\u2019s son. Bach and Trebs collaborated again about 1742, over an organ at Bad Berka. Trebs\u2019s new organ was usable during 1714; he had done 14 days\u2019 tuning by 19 May, and was paid off on 15 September. Of this rebuild nothing is known, except that either Bach or the duke was determined that the instrument include a Glockenspiel; great trouble was taken over obtaining bells from dealers in Nuremberg and Leipzig, and it seems that the original set of 29 (a number hard to account for) had to be replaced because of difficulties over blend and pitch. In 1737 the organ had a Glockenspiel on the Oberwerk, but alterations had been made in 1719\u201320 and it does not follow that the Glockenspiel of 1714 was on a manual.", "entities": [[1598, 1602, "TIME", 39, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [1542, 1549, "TIME", 38, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [1458, 1462, "TIME", 37, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [1309, 1316, "PLACE", 36, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [1295, 1304, "PLACE", 35, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [1158, 1162, "PERSON", 34, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [1091, 1103, "TIME", 33, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [1063, 1069, "TIME", 32, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [1026, 1030, "TIME", 31, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [979, 988, "PLACE", 30, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [956, 960, "TIME", 29, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [925, 930, "PERSON", 28, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [916, 920, "PERSON", 27, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [874, 881, "PERSON", 26, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [862, 866, "TIME", 25, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [825, 830, "PERSON", 24, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [812, 816, "TIME", 23, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [792, 807, "TIME", 22, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [784, 788, "PERSON", 21, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [765, 772, "TIME", 20, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [754, 761, "PLACE", 19, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [704, 708, "PERSON", 18, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [698, 702, "TIME", 17, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [688, 694, "PLACE", 16, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [674, 684, "PLACE", 15, "rgb(84, 26, 204)"], [643, 652, "TIME", 14, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [631, 641, "PERSON", 13, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [613, 625, "TIME", 12, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [553, 557, "TIME", 11, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [493, 507, "PERSON", 10, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [460, 466, "TIME", 9, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [431, 437, "TIME", 8, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [418, 427, "PERSON", 7, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [369, 376, "TIME", 6, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [308, 312, "TIME", 5, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [285, 289, "PERSON", 4, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [217, 224, "TIME", 3, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [176, 180, "TIME", 2, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"], [163, 167, "PERSON", 1, "rgb(104, 239, 176)"], [66, 70, "TIME", 0, "rgb(222, 116, 49)"]]}, {"content": "In December 1709 and February 1710 Bach was paid for repairing harpsichords in the household of the junior duke, Ernst August and Prince Johann Ernst.

On 27 November he was at Weimar, as godfather to Trebs\u2019s son. At about this time he seems to have gone to Halle, perhaps to buy music, and to have become accidentally involved with the authorities of the Liebfrauenkirche. The organist there (Zachow, Handel\u2019s teacher) had died in 1712, and the organ was being enlarged to a three-manual of 65 stops. The story has to be pieced together from hints in an incomplete correspondence; but it looks as if the pastor, J.M. Heineccius, pressed Bach to apply for the vacant post. Bach may have been involved in planning the enlargement of the organ, when Zachow became incapacitated; at all events, he stayed in Halle from 28 November to 15 December at the church authorities\u2019 expense. He also composed and performed a cantata (lost), attended a meeting on 13 December 1713, was offered the post, and let the committee suppose that he had accepted it, although he had not had time to find out what his casual fees would amount to. On 14 December they sent him a formal contract. Bach replied on 14 January 1714, saying cautiously that he had not been released from Weimar, was uneasy about his salary and duties, and would write again within the week. Whether he did so is not known; but on February the committee resolved to tell him that his salary was not likely to be increased. Thus at Halle he could expect a slightly smaller salary than he was already getting; the attraction was the organ, more than twice as large. Bach must then have approached the duke, for on 2 March, \u2018at his most humble request\u2019, he became Konzertmeister (ranking after the vice-Kapellmeister), with a basic salary of 250 florins from 25 February. In finally refusing the Halle post, he probably mentioned that figure, for the committee accused him of having used their offer as a lever to extract more money from the duke. This he denied on 19 March, in a letter so reasonable and so obviously honest that he remained on good terms with Halle and was employed there as an organ examiner in 1716.

Apart from such intentional irregularities, there are gaps in the series, and the strange thing is that these gaps became suddenly more numerous after the end of 1715.

His subsequent remark about the social step down from Kapellmeister to Kantor must be seen in the context of his later disagreements with the Leipzig authorities, as indeed the letter in question (to Erdmann, a friend of his youth, on 28 October 1730) makes unequivocally clear. In any event, Bach was not the only Kapellmeister to apply for the post. The duties were incomparably more varied and demanding than those in C\u00f6then or Weimar (to say nothing of M\u00fchlhausen or Arnstadt) and more or less corresponded to those undertaken by Telemann in Hamburg. It cannot have been mere chance that Bach wanted to tackle a range of duties comparable with those of his friend.

This activity centred on the \u2018Hauptmusic\u2019 composed for Sundays and church feasts. The performance of a polyphonic cantata, with a text related as a rule to the Gospel for the day, was a tradition inherited from previous Kantors. Even so, Bach engaged on a musical enterprise without parallel in Leipzig\u2019s musical history: in a relatively short time he composed five complete (or nearly complete) cycles of cantatas for the Church year, with about 60 cantatas in each, making a repertory of roughly 300 sacred cantatas. The first two cycles were prepared immediately, for 1723\u20134 and 1724\u20135; the third took rather longer, being composed between 1725 and 1727. The fourth, to texts by Picander, appears to date from 1728\u20139, while the fifth once again must have occupied a longer period, possibly extending into the 1740s. The established chronology of Bach\u2019s vocal works makes it clear that the main body of the cantatas was in existence by 1729, and that Bach\u2019s development of the cantata was effectively complete by 1735. The existence of the fourth and fifth cycles has been questioned, because of their fragmentary survival compared with the almost complete survival of the first, second and third; but until a positive argument for their non-existence can be put forward the number of five cycles, laid down in the obituary of 1754, must stand. Compared with the high proportion of Bach\u2019s works of other kinds that are lost (orchestral and chamber music, for instance), the disappearance of about 100 cantatas would not be exceptional.

The two largest churches in Leipzig are both Gothic in style, and in Bach\u2019s time they contained stone and wooden galleries. The choir lofts were on the west wall of the nave above the council gallery. The organs too were in the choir lofts (the \u2018Sch\u00fcler-Chor\u2019): the Nikolaikirche and the Thomaskirche each had a three-manual organ with 36 and 35 stops respectively (Oberwerk, Brustwerk, R\u00fcckpositiv, Pedal).

The affair developed into a public controversy, the literary conduct of which, at least, was suspended only in 1739 after further polemical writings by Scheibe and Birnbaum. Scheibe acknowledged Bach\u2019s extraordinary skill as a performer on the organ and the harpsichord, but sharply criticized his compositions, claiming that Bach \u2018by his bombastic and intricate procedures deprived them of naturalness and obscured their beauty by an excess of art\u2019. Birnbaum\u2019s not particularly skilful replies fail to recognize the true problem, which lies in a clash of irreconcilable stylistic ideals. Nevertheless, his discussion of naturalness and artificiality in Bach\u2019s style, and his definition of harmony as an accumulation of counterpoint, make some important statements about the premisses and unique character of Bach\u2019s compositional art, and Bach himself must have been involved in their formulation.
